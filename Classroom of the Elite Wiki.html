She warns the students that they are judged on merit. Kiyotaka navigates the system being careful about how he spends the points, while meeting the gregarious Kikyo Kushida and attempting to make peace with his selfish classmate Suzune Horikita. In an attempt to help Kushida become friends with Suzune, Kiyotaka brings them to a cafeteria, having secretly invited them and two other classmates. However, Suzune sees through the plan and leaves them. On April 30, the majority of Class-D lavishly spends their points and slacks off in class without reprimanding, making Kiyotaka suspicious. On May 1, the Class-D students are surprised to find out they did not get any allowance, and Chabashira explains that it depends on merit. After ignoring their studies, the class lacks points for a month.";

      episodeInfo = "Manabu Horikita announces his resignation as the Student Council president. In his place will be Miyabi Nagumo from Class 2-A, who plans to change the school into a meritocracy. After the assembly, Kohei Katsuragi from 1-A advises Kiyotaka, Suzune, and Class-D to be wary of Ryuen. After he leaves, Maya Sato from 1-D bashfully asks Kiyotaka to exchange their numbers and implies she has a crush on him. Despite Class-D coming last for the Festival, none of the students were expelled, much to Ms. Chabashira's surprise and content. She then lets the class know about the next Special Test, which will serve as their final exam: Paper Shuffle. Two students will be paired up and must score above 60 points as a pair -- even if X student scores 0 and Y student scores 60 -- or both students will be expelled. The pairs will be determined through a mini-test, and there is a threshold for the total points from all subjects. Each class will make questions for the exam, which will be answered by one of the other three classes; the class that made the questions can request other classes to do the test, and there will be a lottery in the event of a double request. The requestee and the requestor will go head-to-head, and whichever class scores higher will steal 50 class points from the other. Cheating will result in immediate expulsion. Suzune and Kiyotaka suggest preparing the class for Paper Shuffle. Kei and Kiyotaka exchange emails about her witnessing Maya's confession; Kei, Hirata, and Sudo join Suzune and Kiyotaka to prep for the exam. Kikyo asks to join in, much to Kiyotaka's suspicion; he and Suzune plan to rejoin the others as they leave to prep, as she prepares to tell him about Kikyo's past. Suzune explains that she and Kikyo went to the same middle school. Sometime before graduation, an incident imploded a class and rumour had it that a single female student was the catalyst, whom Suzune believes is Kikyo. Kiyotaka suggests she gets Kikyo expelled, but Suzune believes she can make Kikyo an ally. Meanwhile, Ryuen threatens his class to flush out the spy assisting the 'mastermind' of Class-D, who is revealed to be Shiho Manabe. Ryuen hypothesizes that the mastermind is Kiyotaka or Yukimura, based on their witnesses to Shiho bullying Kei. Kiyotaka and Suzune rejoin the others to devise a plan to have some students purposefully flunk the mini-test so that the highest scorers get paired with the lowest scorers to create an average threshold. Later that night, Kei and Kiyotaka have a conversation about the circumstances of Maya asking him out, and then he vows to protect Kei no matter what. The next day, the class agreed to Suzune's plan for the mini-test; Kiyotaka gets paired with Maya for Paper Shuffle.";

Kikyo rushes out of class as she receives an email. Yukimura offers to oversee a pair for Paper Shuffle -- Akito Miyake and Haruka Hasebe -- noting that unity and cooperation are necessary to win; Suzune asks Kiyotaka to join Yukimura's group to track progress. At Yukimura's study session, the students encourage Kiyotaka to stop holding back -- given his performance at the Festival. Kiyotaka advises preparing for any dirty tricks the classes make for the exam, noting that the school might have a system to mediate questions. Later that same day, Kiyotaka relays that information to Suzune as the two discuss keeping an eye on Kikyo by inviting him to oversee Suzune's group. Kiyotaka receives an email from Ryuen asking who's the mastermind of Class-D. At Suzune's study session, the kids tease Maya and Kiyotaka; afterwards, Suzune meets with Kikyo alone. The two make a bet for the Math exam of Paper Shuffle: if Suzune scores higher, Kikyo will stop messing with her; otherwise, if Kikyo wins, Suzune will get expelled. To acknowledge it as a real bet, Suzune gets her brother to witness the agreement. After he leaves, Kikyo senses that Kiyotaka is on a call with Suzune and asks him to meet with her. At the meetup, Kikyo adds another condition that if she wins, Kiyotaka will get expelled, to which he agrees; by agreeing, he wants to know about Kikyo's past to see why she is the way she is and get the whole picture, to which Kikyo complies. As a child, Kikyo was praised for being a top achiever, so much so that she craved praise and attention, which eventually stopped. She then decided to become the nicest, friendliest, and most caring person, so that others could rely on her and gain everyone's trust. This eventually took a toll on her mentally, despite continuing to put up a front. To combat her distress, she created a personal blog wherein she gossiped about her classmates. On that fateful day, her classmates found her blog and shunned her; tired of keeping up a front, she revealed every dirty secret of all her classmates, which eventually turned the class against themselves and imploded. She implies that she knows truths about some Class-D students, vital enough to ruin them. Getting praised and knowing the dirty truths about people thrills her enough to think about taking drastic measures: a monster created from the desire for recognition. She finishes her tirade by reminding Kiyotaka and Suzune about the conditions of the bet.";

Later, Ryuen intrudes on Kiyotaka's study session and vaguely asks about the email to fish out the Class-D mastermind. A Class-C student, Hiyori Shiina, notes that Kiyotaka and Yukimura have forgettable faces. Thus, she isn't sure if they are the mastermind. Feeling comfortable with the study group, Haruka decides to make a friend group where they share their names with Akito, Kiyotaka, and Yukimura -- who asks to be called Keisei; Airi joins the group as well, dubbed the 'Ayanokoji Group.' Later that night, Kiyotaka calls Kei to play an important part for Paper Shuffle, which she agrees to do so, then sends a birthday wish to him. The next day, Suzune tracks the progress of everyone's study group. Kikyo reminds them to try their hardest, which Kei badly received. She calls out Kikyo for trying to motivate everyone and then not caring when someone fails; Kei then splashes a drink on her but then apologizes for the incident by offering her uniform. Sometime later, Kikyo volunteers to submit the test questions and asks Ms. Chabashira to discard any other copies from Class-D; later, Kikyo gives the questions to Ryuen as per their deal. The test day comes. Hirata is happy that Kei is with Kiyotaka and would be even happier if they date. During the Math test, Kikyo is shocked to see the questions. After the test, Kikyo chides Ryuen for what happened, who lets her know that Suzune saw through it all. Suzune asked Ms. Chabashira to accept her and only her copy of the questions and discard anyone else's. Kikyo finds a cheat sheet on her uniform, meaning that Ryuen handed his class copy to the Class-D mastermind, betraying Kikyo. Much to her chagrin, Kikyo begrudgingly agrees to fulfill her side of the bet, but declares that she'll sabotage Kiyotaka next. Ryuen would either give Class-D his class copy or change Kikyo's questions, to which he chose the latter; angry that Kiyotaka used him, he targets Kei to fish out Kiyotaka.";

The next day, many Class-D students are being provoked by Class-C; Suzune notes that Ryuen is doing this to exploit the mastermind and that he isn't buying into her being said mastermind. While returning Suzune's book to the library, Kiyotaka sees Hiyori from Class-C and the two talk about books they like despite being in rival classes. Afterwards, Kiyotaka is taken to a reception room where his father awaits, whom he hasn't seen in a year and a half. Mr. Ayanokoji begins by saying their butler committed suicide after getting fired for helping Kiyotaka apply for the school and escape his father. Kiyotaka left his family to search for his path and live independently, which his father disallowed; to take matters further, he wants Kiyotaka to sign the school withdrawal form and rejoin the White Room. Just then, Mr. Sakayanagi, the school's chairman and Arisu's father, chimes in that Kiyotaka was enrolled in the school on behalf of Mr. Sakayanagi's recommendation and that no one has the right to forcefully withdraw a student, upon which Mr. Ayanokoji backs off and allows Kiyotaka to stay for now. After the meeting, Kiyotaka chastises Ms. Chabashira for using him for her reasons to ascend to Class-A. Later that night, Kiyotaka apologizes to Kei for using her and that he'll stop his desire to climb Class-D to Class-A as he will leave that to Suzune and Hirata, and he caps off the conversation by saying that this will be their last time talking.";

Realizing something's wrong, Kiyotaka bails on the karaoke plan and instead goes to Ms. Chabashira, asking her to stop Ryuen from harming Kei for Class-D to advance; she agrees after Kiyotaka enlisted the help of Manabu to 'eliminate' Ryuen in exchange for Suzune joining the student council.
